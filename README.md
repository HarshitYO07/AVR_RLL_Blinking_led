# AVR_RLL_Blinking_led
Learn the fundamentals of embedded systems by programming the ATmega328P microcontroller at the register level â€” no Arduino functions, just pure control! This repository starts with the classic LED blink project, demonstrating how to use DDRB and PORTB to control the on-board LED on digital pin 13 (PB5).
